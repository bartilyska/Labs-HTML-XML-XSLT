            				Vannevar Bush was a famous scientist in his days and was the science advisor to
            President Roosevelt during the Second World War, when science-based issues like inventing
            nuclear weapons were of great importance. After "As We May Think" ran in the Atlantic
            Monthly , it caused considerable discussion, and both Time and Life ran stories on
            the  Memex. Life even had an artist draw up illustrations of how the Memex would look
            and a scenario of its projection positions as the user was completing a link. Doug
            Engelbart,  who later became a pioneer in the development of interactive computing
            and invented the mouse, got part of his inspiration by reading Bush's article while
            waiting for a ship home from the Philippines in 1945. In spite of all this early interest
            surrounding the Memex it never got built. As hinted above, our current computer technology
            is still not able to support Bush's vision in its entirety. We do have computers with
            most of the Memex functionality but they are based on a completely different technology
            from the microfilm discussed by Bush.

            					Memex - "memory extender"
            					
            						Bush described the Memex as "a sort of mechanized private file and library"
            and as "a device in which an individual stores his books, records, and communications,
            and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility."
            The Memex would store this information on microfilm, which would be kept in the user's
            desk. This desk was intended to have several microfilm projection positions to enable
            the user to compare different microfilms, in a manner very similar to the windows
            that became popular on personal computers more than forty years later. The Memex would
            have a scanner to enable the user to input new material, and it would also allow the
            user to make handwritten marginal notes and comments. But Bush envisaged that most
            of the Memex contents are purchased on microfilm ready for insertion. Books of all
            sorts, pictures, current periodicals, newspapers, are thus obtained and dropped into
            place. Business correspondence takes the same path. Actually we have not yet reached
            the state of hypertext development where there is a significant amount of preprocessed
            information for sale that can be integrated with a user's existing hypertext structure.

            				Sir Tim Berners Lee is an English computer scientist best known as the inventor
            of the World Wide Web. He is a Professorial Fellow of Computer Science at the University
            of Oxford and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Tim
            Berners-Lee proposed an information management system then implemented the first successful
            communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the
            Internet.

            <h3>HyperCard</h3>
            				HyperCard was a powerful, yet extremely easy to use tool for creating “stacks”
            — essentially flat-file databases that used hyperlinks as a way of navigating a stack
            of “cards”.
